# Bounty_Hunting
Adds in the ability to set a bounty on a player in a MT server. Once you are on the list, the only way to be taken off of it is to be killed, kind of like when an Omega Team is let loose on you.

feel free to test this once I have made this into a WIP mod and officially made a post on the MT forum.

## Installation:
Download the .zip file and extract it. Place the extracted folder into your mods directory. To enable it, select the world you want and click "configure". Under the list of available mods, 

## Extended Description
This mod allows you to set a bounty on anyone that you want to that is currently in the game (or any player if the name is spelled correctly) and the reward for killing that player can be set at any amount so long as the player has the reward. If another player posts a bounty for the same player, the reward will stack up. There is a command to add a player to the blacklist (for an admin or other trusted player) to add a player to the list as a way of dealing with one that you find annoying (i.e. /bounty add <player_name> <reward> <reason>). The reward for fulfilling the contract can be multiple items and the reason is optional but can be used if desired, to let the player know why they have been added to the list. As an optional dependency, you can run the command from the IRC channel if you have one associated with your server.

### Add-ons for the future
There will eventually be the ability to exclude certain players from the blacklist as defined by a priv. This will also prevent them from adding players to the bounty list as a measure against abusing the system.  Another option that will be added in a future release is when a player has been added to the blacklist, everyone can be told about it.

### What happens when you or a player gets Blacklisted:
When a player is added to The List, a chat message will be sent to that player saying "You have been added to the blacklist by <player>. The reward for killing you is <item_name>, x<quantity>." For the player who added someone to The List, it will tell them "You have successfully added <player_name> to The List at the price of <quantity_of_item> <item>."

## Support
If you have any questions, find a bug or exploit or have any issues, please pot the latter two on the GitHub repository. For questions, contact me via IRC (query the name "Mr_Pardison" or "Mr-Pardison" without the quotation marks) or email me at leveragegivestheadvantage@gmail.com

## Notice:
If you run both this mod and rubenwardy's CTF PvP Engine at the same time, the engine will object ot the registration of the bounty_admin priv in both mods. If you wish to avoid this, don't run both at the same time. I say this in order to prevent the conflict of them and cover the possibility of this happening.
